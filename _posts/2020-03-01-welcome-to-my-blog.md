description: "Welcome to my blog!!"

I love to code in Python and in this blog I am going to share everything that I am learning about Data Science and Machine Learning. 

So recently I was working on I had built a script that detected discrepancies between similar images and I decided to use PySide2 for the GUI interface. When I tried building an executable file, it just didn't work out. I looked everywhere, from GitHub to StackOverflow, PySide2 documentation, tried setting up my development environment multiple times, but nothing worked. Finally one of the Python development environment configurations clicked and I was able to build my executable. If you too are facing a similar issue with PySide2, please check out my GitHub repository where I have placed detailed instructions on how to do it correctly.

There are many times when we face a programming problem, but we cannot find a solution in any blog or even in StackOverflow. So this is also a secondary reason why I am writing this blog.

So, finally what is Data Science?? It is the art of extracting important insights from data, analyze it to understand why something has happened, maybe try to predict events based on this analysis and finally present our findings to people (data visualization).
